What is an OS
--------------
Kernel - Core part of the OS that handles the primary memory management
Process - when a program starts to run
Over time CPUs have been using more memory
    Every CPU now has the ability to address memory
        A certain number of pins are dedicated to talk to - or 'address' - memory
        Over time this number went from 8 > 16 > 32 > 64 bits
As a CPU can handle more memory, an OS has to keep up
    Which is why there are x32 and x64 versions of OS
    Software also has to keep up
        Most 64 bit OS can run both 32 and 64 bit versions of software
            But not the other way around
