The Visible Computer
---------------------

What is an OS
--------------
OS - Controls all programs on a computer
Kernel - Core part of the OS that handles the primary memory management
Process - when a program starts to run
Over time CPUs have been using more memory
    Every CPU now has the ability to address memory
        A certain number of pins are dedicated to talk to - or 'address' - memory
        Over time this number went from 8 > 16 > 32 > 64 bits
As a CPU can handle more memory, an OS has to keep up
    Which is why there are x32 and x64 versions of OS
    Software also has to keep up
        Most 64 bit OS can run both 32 and 64 bit versions of software
            But not the other way around
The OS also manages the hardware
    Device Drivers - Software that helps manage different types of devices
        View windows drivers on the Device Manager
    Different OS have different drivers
Storage
    Every OS stores data in folder or file like structures
Networking


Users and Power Users
----------------------
User account - every device has some type of user account
    Uses some type of database to manage usernames/passwords
    Used to allow multiple people to work on the same device by using different accounts
Super user/ administrator account - manage normal user accounts
    Have the power to do anything, whereas a normal user account may have limitations
Every type of computer has built in user accounts and super user/administrator accounts of some form (phones, pc, etc.)


Why Windows?
-------------
Why is windows the predominant OS today
    Bill Gates's salesmanship
        Per processor agreement - Made deal with Intel so that if someone bought an Intel CPU, they get a free copy of windows
    Networking
        Windows made networking easy with windows server
        Windows server has a domain controller, which allows computers to network with each other easily
            Domains are now called active directory
            This feature is called single sign on (SSO) - this is owned by windows
        OS X and Linux use Windows networking software to use single sign on
