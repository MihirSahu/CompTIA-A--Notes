# Power Protection


- Problems with power
    - Spikes (surge) - provide more voltage than what's expected
        - Can destroy computer
    - Sags (brownout) - short term voltage dip
        - Keeps pc from running and cause reboots
- Surge protector - catch big spikes of voltage and stop it from carrying over to system
    - Trip alert - Turn off electricity if any surge is detected
- UPS (Uninterrupted power supply) - protects from both spikes and sags
    - Protests against spikes by witholding electricity, protects against sags by creating electricity with UPS batteries
